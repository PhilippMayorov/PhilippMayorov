ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, 

Iâ€™m Philipp Mayorov, a Computer Science student at Western University.   

What I am currently working on ðŸ‘€ : 

** Camphaven: **

Link: https://camphaven.onrender.com 

Description: A campsite web application marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their campsite with people wanting to accommodate a campsite (similar to Air bnb). Users can view the available places for rent or create an account and post their property for Rent. 

Skills Presented: 
- Used Chainable Route Handlers to ensure valid input from users using Joi nmp Package manager and Bootstrap
- Utilized CRUD as usesr can create, delete, Post and update utilizing Expres and MongoDB 
- Creating an eye-appealing and user-friendly interface using HTML/CSS and bootstrap
- Applied DRY (Dont repeat Yourself) style of coding to minimize code

* Project is still under development. Once completed, it will be hosted online 


ðŸŒ± Future Goals: 

- Apply my skills to a proffesional setting
- Work on a second project (Twitter Senitment analysis). In short, users can input a tweet link, and the web application will calculate its text sentiment score.  
- Learn React Native, PostSQL, AWS, and Machine Learning.
