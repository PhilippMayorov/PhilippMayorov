# ðŸŒŸ Completed Projects

## Free Spotify Premium

Description:
Download your favourite songs and playlists from Spotify for free. Using Spotify's API, this app fetches your playlists, converts songs into high-quality MP3 files, and downloads them directly to your computer.

## Real-Estate Web Scraper

Description:
A real-estate scraper designed to help you find the best deals effortlessly. Simply paste the URL of a real estate browsing page and describe your ideal home using an AI prompt.
For example:
"A house with at least 4 bedrooms, 1500 sq. ft., a monthly rent of $2000â€“$2500, and the ownerâ€™s contact info."

The scraper instantly filters and extracts relevant listings that match your criteria. Within seconds, you'll have a clear, organized table of the best-priced optionsâ€”saving you time and effort.

## CampHaven

Description:
A marketplace for campsite rentals, connecting hosts who want to rent out their campsites with travelers looking for accommodations (similar to Airbnb). Users can view available campsites or create an account to list their own rental.

Skills Demonstrated:

Validation: Implemented chainable route handlers to ensure valid input using the Joi package and Bootstrap.
- CRUD Operations: Enabled users to create, delete, update, and post listings.
- Database Management: Built scalable databases to store user accounts, property listings, and reviews using MongoDB.
- UI Design: Designed an intuitive and appealing interface using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and Mapbox.
- Authentication & Authorization: Secured user accounts, allowing only authorized actions (e.g., editing/deleting listings and reviews).
- Cybersecurity: Implemented measures to prevent MongoDB injection and cross-site scripting attacks.
