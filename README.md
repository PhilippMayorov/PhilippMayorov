ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, 

Iâ€™m Philipp Mayorov, a Computer Science student at Western University.   

What I am currently working on ðŸ‘€ : 

** Camphaven: **

Description: A campsite web application marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their campsite with people wanting to accommodate a campsite (similar to Air BnB). Users can view available places for rent or create an account and post their listing for Rent. 

Skills Presented: 
- Used Chainable Route Handlers to ensure valid input from users using Joi Package Manager and Bootstrap
- Utilized CRUD as users can create, delete, Post and update their listings
- Created scalable Databases that successfully store user account details, Property Listings, and reviews Using MongoDB.  
- Creating an eye-appealing and user-friendly interface using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and Mapblox Package
- User accounts are fully authenticated and Authorized to delete and edit only their listing and reviews.
- Cyber-security implementation prevention such as MongoDB injection, and cross-site scripting.

Fully Deployed and Hosted on Render:

ðŸŒ± Future Goals: 

- I look forward to expanding my knowledge in full-stack development by learning React.js, and PostgreSQL, new ML models. 
- Work on a second project (Twitter Sentiment analysis). In short, users can input a tweet link, and the web application will calculate its text sentiment score.  
- Be part of a professional development team, where everyone is results-driven and creates innovative projects that are impactful to the world
